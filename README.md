# 🕵️‍♀️ careful-download

**🚧 Work in progress!**

A wrapper around [`got`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/got), [`sumchecker`](https://github.com/malept/sumchecker), and [`decompress`](https://github.com/kevva/decompress). Downloads a file and its checksums to a temporary directory, validates the hash, and optionally extracts it if safe.
